Intro to the Dataset and the Aim:
🎯 Objective: For Ola, a leading ride-sharing platform committed to delivering reliable, affordable, and convenient urban transportation, the challenge lies in optimizing driver retention to sustain operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. Despite its efforts, the company grapples with a persistent churn rate among its drivers, necessitating a proactive approach to ensure driver loyalty and minimize attrition.To address this challenge, Ola seeks to leverage its wealth of driver data to uncover underlying patterns in driver behavior, performance, and satisfaction. By harnessing the power of data science and ensemble learning techniques, Ola aims to develop predictive models capable of anticipating potential driver churn. These models will serve as a cornerstone of Ola's driver retention strategy, enabling the company to implement timely interventions and tailored incentives to mitigate churn risk effectively.
